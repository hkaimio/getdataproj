Submission for Coursera "Getting and cleaning data" course project.

This script merges the feature vectors from both training and test part of  UCI human 
activity recognition data set, extracts mean and standard deviation of each measured 
parameter for each sample and summarizes these by calculating mean for those for each 
subject and activity.

Execute the __run_analysis.r__ script in the top directory of the data set. Results 
will be stored in file __summary.txt__ and also in R variable summary.
